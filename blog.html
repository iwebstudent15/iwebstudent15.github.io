                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">June 21, 2019</div>
                <p> On Monday, we unfortuantely had to delete our CSS that we did last week on Fun Friday. I had worked
                    very hard trying to match the colors so
                    it was pretty hard to delete all the CSS that we had done. BUT, I was able to make my website a more
                    exciting website by adding the about
                    page and blog page. I also added my hero picture, and I think it looks amazing. I showed it to my
                    family and they said that it was worth
                    making me go to coding class, which I kind of also agree on.</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">June 14, 2019</div>
                <p> This week we logged into our GitHub accounts and made our Summer Website. It was very difficult
                    because we had to tyep each line of code.
                    We also made a live, working website! I am very proud of myself becasue I usually get bored when i
                    just type for a very long time but,
                    if it's about coding, I could type several lines of code!!! I also like how Mr.G is very patient
                    with us whne we have minor bugs and errors.
                    I am very curious of what we are going to do nexxt week!</p>
