                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">July 12,2019</div>
                <p> This week we learned about design patterns, site headers and heros. We also added something new into
                    our website, a image gallery! It was a little complicated to do because we had to use Adobe
                    Photoshop,
                    and we also had to code some lines, (because we used some Fancy Box, and we could copy and paste the
                    lines of code. ) but I think that the image gallery turned out ok. I am very exited about what we
                    are
                    going to do next week.

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">July 5,2019</div>
                <p> This week we were working on how to link our prototypes to make a working prototype, like a website.
                    Something that I realized on Adobe XD was that there was actually a place where you had to click to
                    duplicate the form-ish thingy. I have always done it wrong, so that was why it took several minutes
                    just to duplicate once. I am very grateful that I acually have a tablemate that does their work that
                    they
                    are supposed to do, and helps me when I need help with something, BUT the other boy sittng next to
                    me
                    doesnt do his work. </p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">June 28,2019</div>
                <p> This week we logged into our Adobe Accounts and started to create our prototype of our website. It
                    was very challenging to make because I didn't know how to duplicate all of my stuff. I always messed
                    up and it was very stressful. The boy sitting on the right of me was very annoying, and did not do
                    what he was
                    supposed to do. </p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">June 21, 2019</div>
                <p> On Monday, we unfortuantely had to delete our CSS that we did last week on Fun Friday. I had worked
                    very hard trying to match the colors so
                    it was pretty hard to delete all the CSS that we had done. BUT, I was able to make my website a more
                    exciting website by adding the about
                    page and blog page. I also added my hero picture, and I think it looks amazing. </p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">June 14, 2019</div>
                <p> This week we logged into our GitHub accounts and made our Summer Website. It was very difficult
                    because we had to tyep each line of code.
                    We also made a live, working website! I am very proud of myself becasue I usually get bored when i
                    just type for a very long time but,
                    if it's about coding, I could type several lines of code!!! I also like how Mr.G is very patient
                    with us whne we have minor bugs and errors.
                    I am very curious of what we are going to do next week!</p>
